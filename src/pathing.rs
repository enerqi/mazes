// - Todo cell content printing
// def content_of(gridcoordinate) for printing floodfill algorithm etc: ascii base36 letter (or base 64 maybe).
// Grid trait?

// Dijkstra's Algorithm
// For *each* cell we can generate floodfill data (matrix of steps to each other cell - hashtable really).
// GridCoordinate: steps from from start mapping.
// Can be stored as a Vector of certain size.

// apply pathing algorithm to grid and get extra data structure info out of it...for every cell!

// How to map a gridcoordinate to a vector location? It depends on the *dynamic* aspect of the Grid size and dimension.
// So it's not a compile time decision.
// How to safely associate with only 1 live grid?
// Well OO would make is a subclass with new data and a bloated base interface.
// - The pathing data needs to record the size/dimension at initialisation time
//   x this has no guarantee to be calculated for the relevant grid
// OR
// - The pathing data needs to be initialised with a reference to the grid processed
//   x this is an immutable borrow, which would perhaps inconveniently prevent other mutable updates to the grid
//   âœ“ any mutation of the grid (most Grid functions are immutable) could invalidate the pathing data
//   ? we could always copy the pathing data into a new data structure without the &Grid
//     In this case we almost want persistent data structures, old versions around - perhaps of the pathing data and the graph
// OR
// - Weak (requires downgrading an RC<T>) pointer or RC<T>
//   x requires heap allocating the graph, though that's much data - most of it is implemented as Vectors anyway.
